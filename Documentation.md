**Notes**
    
* (#) for heading
* _ or * (withoutspace) for Italics
*  ** for bold
* for ordered listing simply use numbers
* use * for unordered listing
* use ~~ for text with cut
* for adding Links we can use [] where inside square brackets comes the name which will show on the link then comes () inside this comes the link. If we want to add like if someone hovers over the link then show some text then we can add text in " " that need to be displayed inside the brackets after the link with a space.
* similarly for adding images just add ! before in the link procedure.
* To write any piece of code with higlighting use three aposhtrophe signs(') then the programming language and you must end with three aphostrophe signs when you are finished with your code.
* to add any quotes use > sign.
* we can use three dash or three astreick signs to add horizontal line
