## Week 1 (First four Days)
Learned about Github like how to create a repo, make a branch, commit changes and merge to master branch.

How to dual boot and install ubuntu and use various linux commands.

How to edit markdown(.md) files
    
**Notes**
    
* (#) for heading
* _ or * (withoutspace) for Italics
*  ** for bold
* for ordered listing simply use numbers
* use * for unordered listing
* use ~~ for text with cut
* for adding Links we can use [] where inside square brackets comes the name which will show on the link then comes () inside this comes the link. If we want to add like if someone hovers over the link then show some text then we can add text in " " that need to be displayed inside the brackets after the link with a space.
* similarly for adding images just add ! before in the link procedure.
* To write any piece of code with higlighting use three aposhtrophe signs(') then the programming language and you must end with three aphostrophe signs when you are finished with your code.
* to add any quotes use > sign.
* we can use three dash or three astreick signs to add horizontal line

## Week 1 (last three days)

>Learning python programming language

first 2 days were reading the python official [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) the topics included -
1. basic data types like lists strings and expressions using python IDLE.
2. Read about control flow tools.
     - if, else and elif statements and their syntax
     - for and while loops
     - defining functions and other useful functions
3. The various data structures
     - using lists as stack, queue.
     - list comprehensions.
     - tuples, sets and dictionaries
     - looping techniques
4. Reading about formatting output and reading and writing data from a file.
5. Errors and exception handling which include try, except and raise statements.
6. Object Oriented proframming
     - classes and instances 
     - inheritance
     - Private variables 
     - generators and iterators

Next we have to go through the basics, data science tutorials and advanced tutorials(first half) from this [site](https://www.learnpython.org/) which covered the bascis of python, numpy and a bit of panda.
In the last from this [site](https://scipy-lectures.org/) covered the first topic which included intro to important libraries of python like numpy, matplotlib and scipy.

The last two sites were advanced and long so it extended to mid of next week.

## Week 2

In this week Our major focus was on the Assignment which was assigned as a team of 4. The assignment consisted of four problems in which each member has to one problem.
I did the 4th problem.
Most of the time was spent in debugging as problem asked for implementing code without loops of inbuilt functions.
Also practiced some questions on [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python).
